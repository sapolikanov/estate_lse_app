# Showcase of the "Estate origins of democracy?..." paper

This is a repository containing only the full version of the "Estate origins of democracy?..." paper for the application to LSE MPhil/PhD in Economic History.

I have a private repository with the paper, data analysis and everything required for reproduction, but I do not intend on making it public as I am considering publishing the work.
